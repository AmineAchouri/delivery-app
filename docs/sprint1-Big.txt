Here’s the next step sequence to move forward (beyond Kong/OpenAPI), focusing on scaffolding and CI/CD.

Repository structure (mono-repo)
admin/ (React)
mobile/ (Flutter)
backend/ (Node.js Express + Lambdas)
infra/ (IaC, env configs)
packages/shared/ (types, auth utils, OpenAPI schemas)
docs/ (ERD, specs)
Database migrations and seed
Choose tool: Prisma or Knex (PostgreSQL).
Implement schema from ER model.
Seed: permissions, default roles (OWNER, STAFF, DELIVERY_AGENT, CUSTOMER), features (PAYMENT, DELIVERY_TRACKING, WEB_CLIENT, ANALYTICS, INVOICING).
Backend scaffolding
Express service: auth, users/roles, menus, offers, orders.
Lambda functions: media upload (signed URLs), image processing, invoice generation, daily stats aggregation.
Middleware: require X-Tenant-ID, JWT validation, feature-flag check.
Object storage
S3 buckets: media-uploads, media-public.
Signed URL upload flow, basic image resizing Lambda.
Admin app scaffolding
Auth pages, tenant switcher.
Feature flags fetch, settings page.
Basic CRUD pages: Menu, Categories, Items, Offers.
Mobile app scaffolding
Login, menu browse, cart, checkout, order tracking.
Uses HTTPS to API Gateway, X-Tenant-ID header set per tenant.
CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions)
admin: build → deploy to Vercel (dev/staging/prod).
backend: test → migrate DB → deploy Express to AWS (ECS/EC2 or Lambda via API Gateway for specific tasks).
lambdas: build → deploy (SAM or Serverless Framework).
mobile: build pipelines to TestFlight/Internal App Sharing (no store release yet).
Environments and secrets
dev/staging/prod in AWS SSM Parameter Store.
KMS for JWT private keys.
Per-tenant config stored in TENANT_FEATURE/TENANT_SETTING.
